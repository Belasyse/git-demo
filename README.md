# Git Demo

## Task 1: The mini-website fixer-upper

This is a small task for a very basic website. It's not responsive, it's not done with Sass, it's not even coded very well! But you've been asked by the client to fix some mistakes, add new stuff, and change some styling.

Try to commit your changes in small chunks – perhaps even one request at a time. It'll feel like overkill, but for the purposes of learning how to commit to Git, practice makes perfect.

I'll run through the set-up and how to commit on the projector.

### Task 1a: Mistakes

* Blog appears twice in the navigation menu. Change the second one to "Contact"
* Phil's surname is spelt wrong. It's Shackleton
* Aaron's name is the wrong way around! It's Aaron Thomas
* Luke's taste in films is terrible, please delete his summary!
* Change the copyright year to 2014 – 2015

### Task 1b: Additions

__Emily__ is missing! Please add her!

* __Name:__ Emily Cressey
* __Occupation:__ Web Developer
* __Summary:__ Tattoo fanatic. Loves beardy hipsters.
* __Twitter:__ emilyvc_

### Task 1c: Styling

* Change the colour of the navigation bar to one of the Mixd primary colours (Red: #d62323 or Blue: #1b49be)
* Make the people's names bigger
* Make their occupation so it's italicised
* The colour of the Twitter button is wrong, it should be __#55ACEE__

### Task 1d: Collaborate

Invite me (thecodezombie) to your GitHub Repo, and we'll spend a few minutes one-to-one. We'll discuss little changes we can make, and choose who's going to do what. Then we'll code at the same time!

Fingers crossed for no conflicts!

### Task 2: Your own project, in GitHub

Task 1 existed for you to get to grip with the basics of using GitHub, both on your own and collaboratively. It was purposely really basic, so you focussed on the commit/push/pull side of Git.

Task 2 is your own free-reign to put one of your own projects. Don't worry, we won't judge if you use FTP to deploy changes to the server&hellip; you're using Git to store your changes!
